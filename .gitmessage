#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in body
#   * Always use the English language to answer these questions
